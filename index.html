    <div class="personal">
      <p>My name is Shawn Bennett, and I am very excited to begin work in
        this new world of programming. I am a married 40 year old with two
        daughters. I have been employeed by AT&T for 20 great years, and have
        been blessed with the ability to work in quite a few different positions
        . I have field technician and field manager experience completing work
        on telephones, ADSL, IPDSL, VDSL, IPTV, and Satellites. I worked in a control
        dispatching center. I have performed project management. I have been
        able to provide technicnal training and support on many differnt systems
        and technologies. For the last few years I have been a Distric level
        staff support for an organization consisting of up to 1000 employees.
        In the District staff role I have oversight of; large budgets,
        productivity, performance, systems, websites, and project managment of
        an exciting and ever-changing telecom environment. Programming is going
        to afford me the ability to pivot my skills learning into a brand new
        world that we will see in the coming years. Thank you for taking the
        time to read my story and review my recent trip to Disney World with my
        family.

        The Wizarding World of Harry Potter was my Daughters' favorite pick.
        Drinking Butter Beer at The Three Broomsticks, seeing the school of
        Hogwarts, sitting on Hagrid's motorcyle, riding the train to the
        school... were does the excitement end? The kids love the dualing
        dragons roller coaster so much, we ended up riding it over and over!

        What we do for our kids... Who in their right mind is going to get
        full face make-up first thing in the morning in FLORIDA?!? Who?
        This guy, that's who. The Pirates of the Caribean was my favorite when
        I was a kid, and it continues to be high on the list.
